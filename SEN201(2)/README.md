# SEN ASSIGNMENT – Student Management System (Python)

## 1. Project Overview
This project is a Student Management System developed using Python.
It allows users to add, view, and remove student records.
The system uses Object-Oriented Programming and file storage.

---

## 2. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 2.1 Requirement Analysis
The system should:
- Store student information
- Allow adding, viewing, and deleting students
- Save data permanently

### 2.2 System Design
- Student class: represents a student
- StudentManagementSystem class: controls operations
- JSON file: stores student data

### 2.3 Implementation
Python was used because it is simple and readable.
Each function performs a clear task.

### 2.4 Testing
- Added students
- Viewed students
- Deleted students
- Restarted program to confirm data persistence

### 2.5 Deployment
Run using:
python student_management_system.py

### 2.6 Maintenance
The system can be updated to include:
- Login system
- Database (MySQL)
- GUI interface

## 3. Explanation of Each Function (Layman Terms)

- add_student():
  Collects student details and saves them like writing in a notebook.

- view_students():
  Displays all stored students like reading from a list.

- remove_student():
  Deletes a student record like erasing a name.

- save_students():
  Saves information permanently in a file.

- load_students():
  Reads saved data when the program starts.

- menu():
  Shows options and controls what the user wants to do.

## 4. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the full SDLC and basic Python programming.
It is simple, effective, and easy to understand.
